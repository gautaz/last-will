# Results on `2018-06-12T12` (MQTT connection over a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket))

The following logs were produced by using MQTT connections over WebSockets (port `9883`):

- [no last will](./2018-06-12T12:39:45.709657600Z-no-last-will.txt) shows what happens without any last will setting on connection
- [last will](./2018-06-12T12:45:49.003997500Z-last-will.txt) shows what happens with the last will set on connection

## Comparison with native connections

There is one key difference with native connections impacting the way MQTT clients are dealing with a disconnection.

On native connections, the client deals directly with the network socket to close.
This means that when the client is unable to disconnect from a native connection, it has to wait for the socket timeout which is by default 300 seconds on Linux.
The test results for native connections were stopped before these 5 minutes, that is why there is no observable complete disconnection.

With WebSockets, the client does not deal directly with the network socket but with the additional WebSocket layer.
This means that when the client wants to disconnect, this disconnection is handed over to the WebSocket.
As a matter of fact, as soon as the WebSocket acknowledge for the disconnection, the client considers itself disconnected.
This is why the following tests show a `Cycle 4` as the client is able to complete `Cycle 3`.

Anyway the client is not able to operate a connection during `Cycle 4` as the network is down since `Cycle 3`.
As a result, `willy` will display a `disconnect` approximately every 5 seconds due to its reconnection attempts.

## Without a last will

The `Cycle 3` and `Cycle 4` log is the following:

```

This log differs from the previous cycles at the moment `willy` initiates its disconnecting sequence:

```
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:41:38.577197500Z connected: false was published
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:41:38.577824400Z disconnect
...
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:42:08.544903600Z disconnected
```

The client was able to disconnect (at least it thinks so), but its last publication was not received by `mqtt`.

At `12:41:47` (UTC), `mqtt` receives a `PINGREQ` (ping request) from the `monit` client.

It also expects to receive a `PINGREQ` from the `willy` client [approximately at the same time](./2018-06-12T07:04:21.227103300Z-no-last-will.txt).
As this `PINGREQ` was not received, `mqtt` starts the `keepAlive` disconnection timer and, one minute later, it disconnects `willy`:

```
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T12:42:47.986271600Z 1528807367: Client mqttjs_2253d67a has exceeded timeout, disconnecting.
...
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T12:43:09.079711300Z 1528807389: Socket error on client mqttjs_2253d67a, disconnecting.
```

> An additional 20s delay seems to occur between the disconnection instruction (12:42:47) and the socket disconnection (12:43:09).

As `willy` did not set any last will on connection, `mqtt` did not emit anything after `willy` disconnection.

## With a last will

The `Cycle 3` and `Cycle 4` log is the following:

willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:49:39.978614700Z disconnect
```

As for the previous test, the disconnection occured:

```
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:47:42.910547800Z connected: false was published
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:47:42.914009200Z disconnect
...
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T12:48:12.910549400Z disconnected
```

The publication and the disconnection both failed (at least from the point of view of the `mqtt` service).

Again a `PINGREQ` is emitted by `monit` at `12:47:51` and `mqtt` also expects `willy` to operate a ping as it has not succeeded to disconnect.

60 seconds later, the `keepAlive` timer goes off and `mqtt` disconnects `willy`:

```
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T12:48:52.624502100Z 1528807732: Client mqttjs_f1a445e4 has exceeded timeout, disconnecting.
...
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T12:49:13.072180100Z 1528807753: Socket error on client mqttjs_f1a445e4, disconnecting.
```

> The same additional 20s delay occurs between the disconnection instruction (12:48:52) and the socket disconnection (12:49:13).

**But this time**, `mqtt` also publishes the last will message set by `willy` during its connection:

```
monit_1  | 2018-06-12T12:49:13.073663600Z test/connected: false
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T12:49:13.073060400Z 1528807753: Sending PUBLISH to mqttjs_ac907bd8 (d0, q0, r0, m0, 'test/connected', ... (5 bytes))
```

> Notice that the delay between the effective disconnection and the last will message is close to 100ms.
> Considering the 20 seconds additional delay between the disconnection instruction and the socket disconnection, the overall delay is still acceptable compared to the `keepAlive` period (60 seconds).

This was tested at least 5 times under the same conditions and the last will message was always received by `monit` in the same second the `willy` connection socket is closed.
