# Results on `2018-06-12T07` (native MQTT connection)

The following logs were produced by using native MQTT connections (port `1883`):

- [no last will](./2018-06-12T07:04:21.227103300Z-no-last-will.txt) shows what happens without any last will setting on connection
- [last will](./2018-06-12T07:09:21.365715700Z-last-will.txt) shows what happens with the last will set on connection

## Without a last will

As for all tests, the disconnection occured during `Cycle 3` after `monit` has received the `true` payload on the `test/connected` topic.

The `Cycle 3` log is the following:

```

This log differs from the previous cycles at the moment `willy` initiates its disconnecting sequence:

```
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T07:06:13.367070700Z connected: false was published
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T07:06:13.367501700Z disconnect
```

Two points are showing that a disconnection occured:

1. The `willy` publication is not received by `mqtt`
2. `willy` tries to disconnect but fails to (no `disconnected` log)

At `07:06:22` (UTC), `mqtt` receives a `PINGREQ` (ping request) from the `monit` client.

It also expects to receive a `PINGREQ` from the `willy` client approximately at the same time because:

- all clients are using the default `keepAlive` setting which is 60 seconds
- the cycles duration is 30 seconds
- both `monit` and `willy` started approximately at the same time

As this `PINGREQ` was not received, `mqtt` starts the `keepAlive` disconnection timer and in fact, one minute later, it disconnects `willy`:

```
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T07:07:22.672349600Z 1528787242: Client mqttjs_d668f3fa has exceeded timeout, disconnecting.

```

As `willy` did not set any last will on connection, `mqtt` did not publish anything after `willy` disconnection.

## With a last will

The `Cycle 3` log is the following:

```

As for the previous test, the disconnection occured:

```
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T07:11:14.333642200Z connected: false was published
willy_1  | 2018-06-12T07:11:14.333951300Z disconnect
```

The publication and the disconnection both failed.

Again a `PINGREQ` is emitted by `monit` at `07:11:23` and `mqtt` also expects `willy` to operate a ping as it failed to disconnect.

60 seconds later, the `keepAlive` timer goes off and `mqtt` disconnects `willy`:

```
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T07:12:23.336025400Z 1528787543: Client mqttjs_c328652c has exceeded timeout, disconnecting.
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T07:12:23.336117000Z 1528787543: Socket error on client mqttjs_c328652c, disconnecting.
```

**But this time**, `mqtt` also publishes the last will message set by `willy` during its connection:

```
mqtt_1   | 2018-06-12T07:12:23.438391000Z 1528787543: Sending PUBLISH to mqttjs_d1997107 (d0, q0, r0, m0, 'test/connected', ... (5 bytes))
monit_1  | 2018-06-12T07:12:23.438697900Z test/connected: false
```

> Notice that the delay between the disconnection and the last will message is close to 100ms.

This was tested at least 10 times under the same conditions and the last will message was always received by `monit` in the same second `willy` was disconnected.
